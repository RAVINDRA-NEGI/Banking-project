# 🏦 Banking Microservices Project

A backend microservices-based banking system built using **Spring Boot**, designed to simulate real-world banking operations like account management, card handling, and loan services. This project showcases the use of microservices architecture with centralized configuration, service registration, and potential scalability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAVINDRA-NEGI/Banking-project.git
cd Banking-project
2. Run Config Server First
bash
Copy
Edit
cd configserver
./mvnw spring-boot:run
3. Run Other Microservices
In separate terminals, navigate to each microservice and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../accounts
./mvnw spring-boot:run
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../cards
./mvnw spring-boot:run
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../loans
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Make sure the config server is running before starting any other services.

🧪 Testing the APIs
You can test endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL. Each service exposes its own REST APIs.

Examples:

GET /api/accounts/{id}

POST /api/cards

GET /api/loans/{customerId}

More details will be available in the individual service documentation.

🛠️ Configuration
All service configurations are managed centrally via configserver.

Config files are expected to be in a separate Git repository (linked in configserver application.yml).

📦 Build the Project
To build any microservice individually:

bash
Copy
Edit
./mvnw clean install
📌 TODOs & Improvements
 Add Eureka Server for service discovery

 Implement API Gateway

 Add JWT-based Authentication

 Add Swagger/OpenAPI docs

 Containerize services using Docker

 Add centralized logging (ELK/Splunk)
